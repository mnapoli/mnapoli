### Hi, I'm Matthieu ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer passionate about helping others **create**.

I work on that through open-source projects, [consulting](https://null.tc/), [conference talks](https://mnapoli.fr/presentations/) and more. Company sponsorships help me make open-source sustainable: [sponsor my work](https://github.com/sponsors/mnapoli).
