### Hi, I'm Matthieu 👋

I try to make serverless more accessible to everyone.

I work on the [**Serverless Framework**](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) and [**Lift**](https://github.com/getlift/lift) at [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/), as well as [**Bref**](https://bref.sh/) on my own time.

#### Serverless course

Serverless technologies give developers superpowers to host and scale applications. If you want to get started with serverless, check out my course:
