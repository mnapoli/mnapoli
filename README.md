### Hi, I'm Matthieu ðŸ‘‹

I try to make serverless more accessible to everyone.

I build and maintain [**Bref**](https://bref.sh/), the [**Bref Dashboard**](https://dashboard.bref.sh/), as well as other open-source projects like [**Lift**](https://github.com/getlift/lift).

I previously was working on the [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) at [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/).

#### Serverless course

Serverless technologies give developers superpowers to host and scale applications. If you want to get started with serverless, check out my course:
